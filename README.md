# First-css-project
This is my first professional/serious project and I'm looking forward to finish it and learn a lot from it, ever since I developed my skills in css
I feel confident and my view on the Webpage was different because when I first saw it I knew exactly where to start and how to finish it and I loved seeing
such a progress in myself.
